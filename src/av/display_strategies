Displaying an FFT of the sound input:

while True:
  read a window
  compute the fourier transform
  display the transform

Displaying an FFT of a wav file:

while True:
  read a window
  compute the fourier transform
  display the transform
  wait an appropriate amount of time

More usefully, display an FFT of a wav file while playing it

while True:
  read a window
  compute the fourier transform
  display the transform
  play the window

Displaying a video of a physics simulation

set timer to 1/framerate
while True:
  perform a timestep
  if timer.expired:
    get picture from simulation
    display picture
    reset timer
